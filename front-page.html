<h1>ZINE.CSS</h1>
<h2>Hybrid Virtual / Physical Publication Boilerplate</h2>

<p>
	Zine.css is designed to strike a balance between two mediums: print and digital. It expects the zine artist to use HTML to layout their zine using HTML tools. Then they should be able to hit ctrl-p or ctrl-shift-p to print out a version of their zine. 
</p>

<p>
	I hope to have an easy, open source pathway from you to your zine in production.
