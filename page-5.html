<p><a href="/zine.css.zip"> To create your own zine, download the zip of this project here</a></p>

<p> <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb">Install Google Chrome web Server</a> </p>

<p>Point Chrome Web Server to the folder of the project</p>

<p>You can then use a text editor like <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">notepad</a>, or the classic <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a> to edit each page of the zine as you would any other html file.</p>

<p>Upload the folder to any host (we really like <a href="https://neocities.org/">neocities</a>). Now everyone can look at your zine!</p>

<p>Print out your zine even side then odd side, staple in the center. You have yourself a zine!</p>
<p>Our goal is to make each PDF compatible with every Zine production services!</p>
